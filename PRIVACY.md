# Privacy Policy for Redis Alpine Container for Azure

**Effective Date:** May 9, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the Redis Alpine Container for Azure (hereinafter referred to as "the Container") collects, uses, and shares information. Please read this policy carefully.

**1. No Collection of Personal Data by the Container Itself**

It is important to understand that the Container itself, which provides a Redis 8.0.0 instance, **does not inherently collect or transmit any personal data**. The Container is a runtime environment for the Redis server.

**2. Data Handled by Redis**

The data handled by the Redis server running within this Container is determined solely by the user deploying and operating the Container. This data may include various types of information, including potentially personal data, depending on the user's specific use case.

**We, the publishers of this Container, have no access to or control over the data you choose to store in Redis.**

**3. Usage Information and Monitoring (Optional and User-Controlled)**

Depending on how the Container is deployed and configured within your Azure environment, Azure or other monitoring tools may collect usage information such as:

* Container resource consumption (CPU, memory, network).
* Container logs.
* Redis performance metrics.

**This type of monitoring is typically configured and controlled by the Azure user and is subject to Azure's privacy policies.** We, the publishers of this Container, do not automatically collect this information.

**4. Licensing Information (AGPL-3.0)**

This Container is published under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL-3.0). This license governs the use, distribution, and modification of the Container itself. The AGPL-3.0 focuses on ensuring that users who interact with the software over a network also receive the source code. **The AGPL-3.0 does not impose any specific obligations regarding the privacy of the data handled by the software.**

**5. Your Responsibilities as the User**

As the user deploying and operating the Redis Alpine Container for Azure, you are solely responsible for:

* Determining the types of data you store in Redis.
* Ensuring that your use of Redis and the data you store complies with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to GDPR, CCPA, and any local laws relevant to your operations in Baba Hassen, Algiers Province, Algeria, or elsewhere.
* Implementing appropriate security measures to protect the data stored in Redis.
* Providing your own privacy policy to your users if you are processing personal data using this Container.

**6. No Sharing of Data by Us**

We, the publishers of this Container, **do not collect, store, or share any data** that is processed by the Redis instance running within the Container.

**Note:** This privacy policy is specific to the Container itself.
